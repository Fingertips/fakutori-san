* Add scenario blocks which allow you to add a description to a set of Fakutori calls

  scenario 'Calendar with events in multiple venues' do
    Fakutori(Event).create!(:venue => venues(:melkweg))
    Fakutori(Event).create!(:venue => venues(:paradiso))
  end

* Speed up definition of scenarios by somehow dumping the contents of a scenario
* Invalidate the scenario cache when the file in which it was defined changes
* Fakutori should circumvent attr_accessible / attr_protected so it's easier to initialize models the way you want them
